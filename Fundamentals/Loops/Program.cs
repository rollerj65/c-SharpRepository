// while loop -> repeats a statement or a group of statement while a given condition is true. tests condition before executing loop body
// for loop -> executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviate code that manages the loop variable
// do...while loop -> similar to while, except test condition at end of body.
// nested loops

//Loop control statements
//break -> terminates loop or switch statement, and transfers execution to the statement immediately following loop or switch
//continue -> causes loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition
